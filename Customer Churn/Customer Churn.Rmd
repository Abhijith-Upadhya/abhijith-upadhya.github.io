# **Customer Churn Analysis**

![Source: Voxco.com](https://www.voxco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Everything-you-need-to-know-about-Customer-Churn2.jpg){height=600}

## Introduction

The goal of this analysis is to understand the factors influencing customer churn in a telecom dataset. We aim to explore and visualize various features, inspect patterns associated with churn, and assess the relationships between churn and various demographic, service-related, and financial characteristics. By doing so, we aim to identify key factors contributing to churn and leverage these insights in building predictive models that can help in customer retention efforts.

The analysis starts by examining the dataset structure and handling missing values, followed by visualizing data distributions across several categorical and numerical variables. Subsequently, machine learning models are employed to predict churn, with performance comparisons among various classifiers, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree models.

## Data Visualisation and Analysis

### Gender and Churn Distribution (Donut Charts):

Gender Distribution: Displays the proportions of male and female customers, providing a demographic breakdown.
Churn Distribution: Shows the proportion of customers who churned versus those who stayed. Visualizing these together gives an understanding of the churn rate within each gender group.

```{r gender_churn_distribution}

object_to_int <- function(x) {
  if(is.character(x) || is.factor(x)) {
    return(as.numeric(factor(x)) - 1)  # Subtract 1 to match Python's 0-based encoding
  }
  return(x)
}

## Conclusion

Through this analysis, we identified several key drivers of churn, including monthly charges, tenure, contract type, and additional services like online security. Customers with shorter tenures, higher monthly charges, and flexible contracts were found to have higher churn rates. Moreover, the absence of online security and tech support services was also associated with increased churn.

In predictive modeling, the Random Forest classifier outperformed other models, providing a strong balance between accuracy and interpretability. This suggests that a Random Forest model could be effectively used in customer retention strategies to proactively identify at-risk customers based on these key factors.

Moving forward, the findings from this analysis could be integrated into strategic initiatives, such as offering targeted discounts or personalized service upgrades to at-risk customers. By leveraging these insights, telecom companies can reduce churn rates and enhance customer satisfaction.
