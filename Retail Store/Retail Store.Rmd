## Loading the dataset

### Descriptive Statistics
Data Summary: Descriptive statistics for Units_sold, Price, and Revenue give an overview of central tendencies and variability. This basic step is essential to understand the spread and range of key metrics.

``` {r load_dataset}
# Read the CSV file
data <- read_csv("retail_store.csv")

# Convert 'Date' column to Date and extract the 'Year'
data$Date <- as.Date(data$Date)
data$Year <- year(data$Date)
#data$Year
# Add 'Revenue' column
data$Revenue <- data$Units_sold * data$Price
# Filter out rows where 'Price' and 'Units_sold' are not 0
df <- data %>% filter(Price != 0, Units_sold != 0)

# Data info
str(data)

options(repr.plot.width = 10, repr.plot.height = 4)
# Descriptive statistics for 'Units_sold', 'Price', and 'Revenue'
summary(data[, c("Units_sold", "Price", "Revenue")])
```

## Visualizations and Analysis

### Time Series Analysis

Price Over Time: A line plot shows how the Price of products changes over time. Any trends, seasonal patterns, or sudden price spikes or drops are easily visible here.

``` {r priceovertime}
# Visualization - Price over time
ggplot(df, aes(x = Date, y = Price)) +
    geom_line() +
    ggtitle("Price over time") +
    theme_minimal() 
```

Sales in Units Over Time: A line plot of Units_sold over time shows fluctuations in demand, helping identify peak sales periods and slower months.

```{r salesovertime}
# Visualization - Sales in Units over time
ggplot(df, aes(x = Date, y = Units_sold)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Sales in Units") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Sales Revenue Over Time: Revenue over time helps to pinpoint high-revenue periods and indicates possible trends in sales volume combined with pricing.

```{r  salesrevenueovertime}
# Visualization - Sales Revenues over time
ggplot(df, aes(x = Date, y = Revenue)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Sales Revenues") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Density Analysis

Density Plots:
Price, Stock, Units_sold, and Revenue densities give insights into the distributions of these metrics. For example, if Price density is skewed right, it implies most prices are on the lower end, with a few higher-priced outliers.

```{r densityplots}
# Density Plots
ggplot(df, aes(x = Price)) +
  geom_density() +
  ggtitle("Price Density") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(df, aes(x = Stock)) +
  geom_density() +
  ggtitle("Stock Density") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(df, aes(x = Units_sold)) +
  geom_density() +
  ggtitle("Sales Density") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(df, aes(x = Revenue)) +
  geom_density() +
  ggtitle("Revenues Density") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Sales and Revenue by Year

Scatter Plot - Revenue vs. Sales by Year: This plot shows how revenues correspond to unit sales, color-coded by year, revealing relationships between these metrics. The scatter pattern can indicate if certain years experienced higher variability or concentration.

``` {r revenuescatterplot}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Units_sold, y = Revenue, color = as.factor(Year))) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Revenues vs Sales by Year") +
  theme_minimal()
```


```{r revenueline}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Units_sold, y = Revenue, color = as.factor(Year))) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ggtitle("Revenues vs Sales by Year") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Boxplot - Sales Variability by Year: This boxplot shows sales spread across different years, illustrating any significant year-to-year variability in sales volume.

```{r salesboxplot}
# Boxplot - Sales variability compared by year
ggplot(df, aes(x = as.factor(Year), y = Units_sold)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Sales Variability by Year") +
  theme_minimal()
```

KDE Plot - Sales Variability by Year: KDEs further reveal year-based sales trends, highlighting periods of higher or lower sales density.

```{r kdeplot}
# KDE Plot - Sales variability compared by year
ggplot(df, aes(x = Units_sold, color = as.factor(Year))) +
  geom_density() +
  ggtitle("Sales Variability by Year") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Sales vs Price: A scatter plot with a linear model (regression) visualizes the relationship between price and units sold, potentially revealing elasticity (sensitivity to price changes) by year.

```{r salesvariability}
# Analyzing Sales Variability by Price
ggplot(df, aes(x = Price, y = Units_sold, color = as.factor(Year))) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ggtitle("Sales Variability by Price") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Stock Analysis

Stock Analysis Over Time: Tracking stock over time helps assess if there are predictable cycles in stock replenishment and consumption.

```{r stockanalysis}
# Stock Analysis over Time
ggplot(df, aes(x = Date, y = Stock)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Stock Analysis Over Time") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Stock Density by Year: Density plots of stock can highlight if there are periods with higher or lower stock, possibly indicating seasonal inventory management.

```{r stockdensitybyyear}
# Stock Density by Year
ggplot(df, aes(x = Stock, color = as.factor(Year))) +
  geom_density() +
  ggtitle("Stock Density by Year") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Sales vs Stock by Year: This regression model on sales vs. stock shows if stock levels impact sales, which may reflect supply limitations or overstocking.

```{r salesvsstockbyyear}
# Linear Model - Sales vs Stock by year
ggplot(df, aes(x = Units_sold, y = Stock, color = as.factor(Year))) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ggtitle("Sales vs Stock by Year") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Price and Sales Analysis

Sales by Rounded Price: A boxplot analysis with rounded prices reveals how units sold vary at specific price points.

```{r priceroundcode, include = FALSE}
# Rounded Price and Boxplot
df$price_round <- round(df$Price, 1)
```

```{r salesbyroundedprice}
ggplot(df, aes(x = as.factor(price_round), y = Units_sold)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Sales by Rounded Price") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Sales vs Stock by Rounded Price: This joint plot shows the relationship between rounded prices and stock in relation to units sold, providing insight into how price points influence inventory management.

```{r salesstockroundedprice}
# Joint Plot - Sales vs Stock by Rounded Price
ggplot(df, aes(x = Units_sold, y = Stock, color = as.factor(price_round))) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Sales vs Stock by Rounded Price") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Economic Elasticity Analysis

Elasticity of Demand: A scatter plot of price changes (Price_delta) vs. sales changes (Units_sold_delta) categorized by Revenue_delta helps visualize demand elasticity (how sensitive sales are to price changes). Density plots for elasticity reveal the distribution, which aids in determining if demand is generally elastic or inelastic.

```{r elasticity, include= FALSE}
# Create Economic Analysis dataframe
eco <- df %>% select(Date, Stock, Price, Units_sold, Revenue, Year)

# Calculate correlations
cor(eco %>% select(-Date))

# Calculate percent change for Stock, Price, Units_sold, and Revenue
eco <- eco %>%
  mutate(Stock_delta = (Stock - lag(Stock)) / lag(Stock),
         Price_delta = (Price - lag(Price)) / lag(Price),
         Units_sold_delta = (Units_sold - lag(Units_sold)) / lag(Units_sold),
         Revenue_delta = (Revenue - lag(Revenue)) / lag(Revenue)) %>%
  drop_na()  # Removing the first row with NAs

# Price frame where Price_delta is not zero
pf <- eco %>% filter(Price_delta != 0)

# Calculate elasticity
pf <- pf %>% mutate(elasticity = Units_sold_delta / Price_delta)
```

```{r show}
ggplot(pf %>% filter(Price_delta < 0.75 & Units_sold_delta < 10), aes(x = Price_delta, y = Units_sold_delta, color = Revenue_delta)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Price Delta vs Sales Delta")

ggplot(pf %>% filter(Units_sold_delta < 7), aes(x = Units_sold_delta, y = Revenue_delta)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Sales Delta vs Revenue Delta")
```

```{r correlation, include=FALSE}
# Correlation for the entire dataset
cor(df %>% select(-Date))

# Boxplot of elasticity (elasticity range between -10 and 10)
ggplot(pf %>% filter(elasticity > -10 & elasticity < 10), aes(x = factor(Price), y = elasticity)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Elasticity by Price")

# Scatterplot with Linear Model (Price vs Sales by Year)
ggplot(df, aes(x = Price, y = Units_sold, color = as.factor(Year))) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Price vs Sales by Year")

# KDE Plot for Elasticity
ggplot(pf, aes(x = elasticity)) +
  geom_density() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Density of Elasticity")

# Define classify_elasticity function
classify_elasticity <- function(coef) {
  coef <- round(coef, 2)
  if (coef < -100) {
    return("high_elastic_N")
  } else if (coef < -1) {
    return("elastic_N")
  } else if (coef < 0) {
    return("inelastic_N")
  } else if (coef < 1) {
    return("inelastic_P")
  } else if (coef > 1) {
    return("elastic_P")
  } else {
    return("high_elastic_P")
  }
}

# Apply classification function to elasticity and create a new column
pf <- pf %>% mutate(elastic_class = sapply(elasticity, classify_elasticity))

# Scatter plot classified by elasticity class
ggplot(pf %>% filter(Units_sold_delta < 10 & Units_sold_delta > -2), aes(x = Price_delta, y = Units_sold_delta, color = elastic_class)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Price Delta vs Sales Delta Classified by Elasticity")

```

Elasticity Classification: By classifying elasticity into categories, this analysis allows for better understanding of price sensitivity. Plots based on elastic_class (e.g., inelastic, elastic) demonstrate which price changes strongly impact sales.

## Regression and ANOVA Models

Regression Analysis - Units Sold: A linear regression model predicts Units_sold based on Price and Stock, giving insights into how these factors contribute to sales volume.

```{r reganalysisunitssold}
# Linear regression model for 'Units_sold' as a function of 'Price' and 'Stock'
model1 <- lm(Units_sold ~ Price + Stock, data = df)
summary(model1)

# ANOVA for the model
anova(model1)
```

Regression Analysis - Revenue: Another linear model assesses Revenue as a function of Units_sold, quantifying the impact of unit sales on revenue.

```{r reganalysisrevenue }
# Linear regression model for 'Revenue' as a function of 'Units_sold'
model2 <- lm(Revenue ~ Units_sold, data = df)
summary(model2)
```

## Conclusion

### The study highlights several insights into the retail store’s data:

Demand Patterns: Sales volume shows variability across years, with certain price points and times of year generating higher sales. Seasonal trends are likely at play, as seen in sales and revenue peaks.
Elasticity: The elasticity analysis shows demand’s responsiveness to price changes. Classification into elastic, inelastic, and highly elastic categories enables targeted price-setting strategies, particularly during peak demand periods.

Price-Sales Relationship: Sales are influenced by both price and stock levels, indicating that both demand-side (price sensitivity) and supply-side (stock availability) dynamics are important for optimal inventory management.

Sales Prediction: The regression model for Units_sold suggests that Price and Stock are significant predictors of demand, providing a useful tool for forecasting. This is further validated by the ANOVA results, which confirm the model’s effectiveness.

Overall, the analysis provides actionable insights for pricing, inventory management, and revenue optimization strategies. By identifying elastic products and adjusting prices accordingly, the store can maximize revenue and reduce stock issues.
