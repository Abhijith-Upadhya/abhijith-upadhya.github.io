# **Ski Resorts - EDA and Visualization**

![Source: Skisolutions.com.](https://www.skisolutions.com/app/uploads/2023/05/ski-resorts.jpg)

## 1. Introduction

This report provides an in-depth analysis of ski resorts worldwide. By examining various characteristics—such as the longest ski runs, lift capacities, and child-friendly amenities—we aim to highlight factors important for different types of skiers. Additionally, we analyze resorts with specific features like summer skiing and night skiing, with a focus on European resorts.


## 2. Loading Dataset

We start by loading and preparing the data for analysis, removing missing values and converting data types as necessary. Additionally, we cluster resorts based on geographical location and characteristics like elevation change, lift capacity, and total slopes.

```{r setup1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
library(leaflet)
library(cluster)
library(tidyverse)

# Load the data
resorts <- read_csv("resorts.csv")
snow <- read_csv("snow.csv")
```

## 3. Data Exploration

```{r data_exp}
# Clean `resorts` data
resorts <- resorts %>%
  mutate(
    Price = as.numeric(Price),
    Season = as.factor(Season),
    Child_friendly = as.logical(Child_friendly),
    Snowparks = as.logical(Snowparks),
    Nightskiing = as.logical(Nightskiing),
    Summer_skiing = as.logical(Summer_skiing)
  ) %>%
  na.omit()
```

```{r dont_include, include=FALSE}
# Check for non-numeric values in Latitude and Longitude
summary(resorts$Latitude)
summary(resorts$Longitude)
```

```{r find_NA}
# Check the number of rows with NA values in Latitude or Longitude
missing_data <- resorts %>%
  filter(is.na(Latitude) | is.na(Longitude))
nrow(missing_data)  # Display the count of rows with missing Latitude or Longitude

# Re-import data ensuring Latitude and Longitude are read as numeric
resorts <- read_csv("resorts.csv", col_types = cols(
  Latitude = col_double(),
  Longitude = col_double()
)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Latitude) & !is.na(Longitude))  # Filter out rows with NA in Latitude or Longitude
```

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r eda}
# Adjust the number of clusters to the available data
num_clusters <- min(5, nrow(resorts) - 1)  # Ensure we don't exceed available data

# Perform clustering if we have at least two data points
if (num_clusters > 1) {
  set.seed(123)
  geographical_clusters <- kmeans(resorts[, c("Latitude", "Longitude")], centers = num_clusters)
  resorts$Cluster <- as.factor(geographical_clusters$cluster)
} else {
  print("Insufficient data for clustering even after cleaning.")
}

# Ensure that all character columns are in UTF-8 encoding
resorts <- resorts %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~ iconv(., from = "", to = "UTF-8")))

# Join resorts and snow data by matching Latitude and Longitude
resort_snow <- resorts %>%
  inner_join(snow, by = c("Latitude", "Longitude"))

snow_by_season <- resort_snow %>%
  mutate(Month = month(Month, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(Season, Month) %>%
  summarize(Average_Snow = mean(Snow, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Calculate elevation change and find resorts with the highest peaks and elevation changes
resorts <- resorts %>%
  mutate(Elevation_Change = Highest_point - Lowest_point)

resorts$Resort <- gsub("[0-9?/~`^\\\\]", "", resorts$Resort)
resorts$Resort <- gsub("\\(.*?\\)", "", resorts$Resort)
```

### Resorts offering Summer Skiing with Snow Cannons

This map shows European resorts that offer summer skiing and have snow cannons to ensure consistent snow cover during warmer months.

Snow cannons, also known as "snow guns," are machines used to produce artificial snow by spraying a mist of water into the cold air, which freezes and falls as snow. These are crucial for maintaining snow coverage, especially in warmer seasons or areas with low natural snowfall, ensuring that ski trails are consistently covered and ready for skiers.

```{r summer_cannons_resorts, fig.width= 9, fig.height= 8}
# Filter resorts that offer Summer Skiing and have Snow Cannons
summer_skiing_with_snow_cannons <- resorts %>%
  filter(Summer_skiing == "Yes" & Snow_cannons > 0 & Continent == "Europe")
center_lat <- mean(snow_summary$Latitude, na.rm = TRUE)
center_long <- mean(snow_summary$Longitude, na.rm = TRUE)

# Create map with Leaflet
leaflet(data = summer_skiing_with_snow_cannons) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
  setView(lng = center_long, lat = center_lat, zoom = 5) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    ~Longitude, ~Latitude,
    color = "green",
    radius = 4,
    label = ~Resort,
    popup = ~paste("Resort:", Resort, "<br>", "Summer Skiing: Yes", "<br>", "Snow Cannons: Yes"),
    fillOpacity = 0.5
  ) %>%
  addLegend("topright", colors = "green", labels = "Summer Skiing & Snow Cannons", title = "Summer Skiing with Snow Cannons")
```

## 5. Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into various factors that skiers consider when choosing a resort. From lift capacity to night skiing availability, the diversity of facilities at different resorts allows them to cater to specific skiing preferences. This information will help skiers make informed decisions, whether they seek long runs, beginner-friendly slopes, or unique offerings like summer skiing. As data on ski resorts continues to grow, future analyses could reveal additional patterns and insights into the skiing industry.
