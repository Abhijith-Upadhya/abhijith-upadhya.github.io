## Plotting the necessary details

### Sales by Region
This chart shows the distribution of total sales across different regions. Regions with larger portions contribute more to the companyâ€™s revenue. This visualization helps in identifying the most lucrative regions for focusing marketing campaigns or expansion strategies.

By understanding which region contributes the most to sales, the company can focus on region-specific promotions or address underperforming areas with targeted strategies.

```{r region}
create_donut_chart(sales_by_region, "Region", "Sales by Region")
```


### Sales by Payment Mode
This chart highlights the popularity of different payment methods. A higher portion for a specific payment mode means customers prefer that method.

Recognizing the preferred payment modes allows the business to ensure that these options are always available and improve the payment experience for users, potentially increasing conversion rates.

```{r payment_mode}
create_donut_chart(sales_by_payment_mode, "Payment_Mode", "Sales by Payment Mode")
```


### Sales by Segment
This shows how much revenue is generated from various customer segments, such as "Consumer," "Corporate," and "Home Office."

Identifying the customer segments generating the most revenue helps in tailoring marketing campaigns to target high-value customers and maintain growth.

```{r segments}
create_donut_chart(sales_by_segment, "Segment", "Sales by Segment")
```


### Sales by Shipment Mode
This chart shows how different shipping methods contribute to total sales. Shipment options could range from standard to express delivery.

Understanding which shipping methods are preferred by customers enables optimization of delivery services, improving customer satisfaction and reducing logistics costs.

```{r shipment_mode}
create_donut_chart(sales_by_shipment_mode, "Ship_Mode", "Sales by Shipment Mode")
```


### Sales by Category and Sub-Category
This visualizes the distribution of sales among various product categories and sub-categories, such as technology, furniture, or office supplies.

Identifying the top-performing product categories helps in inventory planning, improving product offerings, and expanding product lines that resonate with customers.

```{r category}
create_donut_chart(sales_by_category, "Category", "Sales by Category")
create_donut_chart(sales_by_sub_category, "Sub_Category", "Sales by Sub-Category")
```


## Observations

# Enhanced Stacked Bar Chart
create_stacked_bar_chart <- function(data, x_var, fill_var, title) {
  ggplot(data, aes_string(x = x_var, y = "Total_Sales", fill = fill_var)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black", width = 0.6) + 
    labs(title = title, x = x_var, fill = fill_var) + 
    theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
    theme(text = element_text(family = "serif"),
          plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),

    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma, expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
}
```

### Most Popular Payment Modes
This chart illustrates the breakdown of total sales by different payment modes. If some payment options significantly outperform others, it suggests customer preferences for convenience or security in transactions.

Businesses can focus on offering seamless experiences for popular payment modes, while considering removing or rethinking less popular options. Additionally, promoting underused methods with incentives might increase usage.

```{r popular_payment}
create_stacked_bar_chart(popular_payment_modes, "Payment_Mode", "Payment_Mode", "Most Popular Payment Modes")
```


### Product Segments
This chart shows the sales performance across different product segments. Some segments may dominate the sales, showing strong customer demand.

The business should increase investment and promotions in segments with higher sales while investigating why certain segments underperform. For lower-performing segments, customer surveys or research might reveal how to enhance their appeal.

``` {r segment}
create_stacked_bar_chart(product_segments, "Segment", "Segment", "Product Segments")
```


### Categories
This stacked chart illustrates the sales contribution of various product categories, helping in the identification of high and low performers.

The business can prioritize marketing and product development efforts in the most profitable categories. For the lower-selling categories, it might indicate a need for product line refreshes or discontinuation.

``` {r categories}
create_stacked_bar_chart(categories_data, "Category", "Category", "Categories")
```

### Delivery Type by Region of Order
This chart represents how different regions prefer shipment methods, revealing geographic preferences.

The business can optimize its logistics strategies based on regional preferences, such as offering faster shipping options in regions that value speed or cheaper options where cost is more sensitive.

``` {r delivery}
create_stacked_bar_chart(delivery_type_region, "Ship_Mode", "Region", "Delivery Type by Region of Order")
```

Marketing Strategy: Highlight secure, easy-to-use payment modes in advertisements, particularly emphasizing mobile-friendly and fast checkout options.

Cost-Cutting Steps: Reduce transaction fees by negotiating better rates with payment processors, particularly for less common payment methods.

Improving Product Range: Align product promotions with specific payment methods, offering product bundles or exclusive deals for payments made through a specific mode.

```{r top_sales_profit}
create_stacked_bar_chart1(top_sales_profit_payment_modes, "Payment_Mode", "Total_Sales", "Top Sales and Profit by Payment Modes")
```


### Customer Segments

Improving Sales: Tailor personalized offers and loyalty programs based on customer segments, especially for high-value consumers.

Marketing Strategy: Create segment-specific campaigns focusing on corporate customers with bulk purchase incentives, and consumer segments with seasonal discounts.

Cost-Cutting Steps: Streamline marketing efforts for underperforming segments, focusing more on profitable demographics.

Improving Product Range: Expand the range of products based on the preferences of the top-performing customer segments, such as launching premium lines for corporate clients.

```{r total_segments}
create_stacked_bar_chart1(customer_segments_data, "Segment", "Total_Sales", "Customer_Segments")
```


### Product Categories

Improving Sales: Offer bundle deals or discounts on lower-performing categories to stimulate interest and clear excess stock.

Marketing Strategy: Focus advertisements on high-performing categories, and create promotional campaigns to boost awareness and demand for less popular ones.

Cost-Cutting Steps: Optimize inventory levels for categories with declining sales, reducing excess stock and associated carrying costs.

Improving Product Range: Introduce complementary products or features to high-selling categories to capitalize on existing demand and upsell.

```{r }
create_stacked_bar_chart1(product_categories_data, "Category", "Total_Sales", "Product_Categories")
```


### Shipping Mode by Regions

Improving Sales: Offer region-specific promotions, such as free shipping or faster delivery in high-demand areas.

Marketing Strategy: Emphasize the advantages of different shipping options in marketing campaigns (e.g., faster deliveries in urban areas).

Cost-Cutting Steps: Implement more efficient shipping logistics for regions that show a preference for certain delivery modes, reducing costs associated with expedited shipping.

Improving Product Range: Consider offering region-specific products based on shipping preferences, especially where shipping logistics play a big role in customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion

The dataset reveals crucial insights into sales performance across various product categories, customer segments, payment modes, and regions. By understanding these patterns, the company can take targeted actions to boost revenue, such as optimizing inventory, tailoring marketing strategies, and offering improved delivery options. 

While certain regions and segments drive most of the sales, there are opportunities for growth in underperforming areas. Additionally, expanding popular product lines and enhancing the customer experience through preferred payment methods and shipping options will help maintain competitiveness. 

Strategic initiatives such as personalized offers and loyalty programs can further increase customer retention and loyalty, leading to sustainable business growth.
